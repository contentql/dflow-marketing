There are 2 ways to install dFlow.

1. **Deploy using Railway** (One click deployment)
2. **Manual Installation** (coming soon)

## Deploy on Railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/NNuPfr?referralCode=I9okFq)

When you deploy dFlow on Railway, it will create a new project in your [dashboard](https://railway.com/dashboard) which includes 3 services:

- **dFlow application**: The main service that handles the core functionality of dFlow.
- **Redis**: The caching service that stores the state of the dFlow application.
- **MongoDB**: The database service that stores the data of the dFlow application.
