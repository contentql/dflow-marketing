When you deploy dFlow on Cloud, it will create a new project in your [dashboard](https://demo.dflow.sh/dashboard) which includes 3 services:

- **dFlow application**: The main service that handles the core functionality of dFlow.
- **Redis**: The caching service that stores the state of the dFlow application.
- **MongoDB**: The database service that stores the data of the dFlow application.
