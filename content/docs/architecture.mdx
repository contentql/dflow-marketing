## DFlow Architecture Overview

DFlow is designed to simplify app deployment and server orchestration without sacrificing power or flexibility. Below is an overview of how its core components work together:

### üîê 1. Agentless Server Control via SSH

DFlow connects directly to your servers over SSH‚Äîno agents required. It securely provisions servers by installing and configuring necessary software, including:

- **Dokku**: A lightweight Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) for containerized app deployment
- **Netdata**: A powerful real-time monitoring tool

This approach keeps your infrastructure clean and transparent, while maintaining full control.

### üåê 2. Automated Proxy & DNS Configuration

Every deployed app is automatically assigned a unique subdomain using nip.io, enabling instant DNS resolution. SSL certificates are provisioned via Let‚Äôs Encrypt, ensuring secure, HTTPS-ready deployments out of the box.

### üöÄ 3. Build & Deployment Pipeline

Applications are containerized using Docker, with support for both:

- Custom **Dockerfiles**
- **Railpack** logic (for simplified builds)

All builds are performed directly on your server, eliminating the need for remote CI/CD and making deployments fast and developer-friendly.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è 4. Cloud-Native Autoscaling (Coming Soon)

DFlow is introducing a novel approach to autoscaling that avoids complex container orchestration layers. Instead, based on traffic or custom triggers, DFlow will:

- Provision a new VPS on your AWS account
- Install Dokku and connect it to your DFlow dashboard
- Register the instance for load-aware app distribution

This makes scaling intuitive, cost-effective, and infrastructure-agnostic.

### üìà 5. Integrated Monitoring & Logs

With Netdata installed by default, every server offers full visibility into:

- Real-time system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, etc.)
- App-specific logs and resource usage
- Alerting and historical trends

All available directly from the DFlow dashboard.
